                <b>Synopsis:</b> American Horror Story is an american horror anthology television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk.
                The franchise seasons of AHS are mostly conceived as self-contained miniseries, following a different set of characters in a new setting within the same fictional universe
                (which the show occasionally utilizes for crossovers between seasons), and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end."
                Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events. Many actors appear in more than one season, usually playing a new character though sometimes as a returning character,
                and often playing multiple characters in a season.

                <b>Synopsis:</b> Band of Brothers is a 2001 American war drama miniseries based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name.
                It was created by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who also served as executive producers, and who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan.
                The series dramatizes the history of "Easy" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from jump training in the United States
                through its participation in major actions in Europe, up until Japan's capitulation and the end of World War II.

                <p class="text-movies">
                The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews
                with Easy Company veterans. The series took some literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members
                of Easy Company. Excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors are used as preludes to the episodes, but they are not identified by name until the end of the finale.

                  <b>Synopsis:</b> The Wire is an American crime drama television series created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon. The idea for the show started
                  out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher.
                  Set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, The Wire introduces a different institution of the city and its relationship to law enforcement in each season while retaining
                  characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order, the illegal drug trade, the port system, the city government and bureaucracy,
                  education and schools, and the print news medium. Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-movies">
                  When the series first aired, the large cast consisted mainly of actors who were unknown to television audiences, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland
                  figures in guest and recurring roles. The Wire is lauded for its literary themes, its uncommonly accurate exploration of society and politics, and its realistic
                  portrayal of urban life. During its original run, the series received only average ratings and never won any major television awards but is now often cited as one of
                  the greatest shows in the history of television.
