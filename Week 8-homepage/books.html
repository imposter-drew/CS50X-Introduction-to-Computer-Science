                    <b>1984</b> also known as <i><b>Nineteen Eighty-Four</b></i> by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">Georg Orwell</a></b>

                  <p></p>
                    <b>1984</b> is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale published on 8 June 1949. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism,
                    mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel
                    on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism, and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.
                  <p></p>
                    The story takes place in an imagined future in an unknown year believed to be 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One,
                    has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by
                    the Party's Thought Police. Through the Ministry of Truth, the Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and constant propaganda to persecute
                    individuality and independent thinking.

                    <b>The Witcher</b> is a series of six fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around the eponymous "witcher",
                    Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who are given supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The Witcher began with
                    a titular 1986 short story that Sapkowski entered into a competition held by Fantastyka magazine, marking his debut as an author.
                    <p></p>
                    Due to reader demand, Sapkowski wrote 14 more stories before starting a series of novels in 1994. Known as The Witcher Saga, he wrote one book a year until the fifth and final installment in 1999. A standalone prequel novel, Season of Storms,
                    was published in 2013. The books have been described as having a cult following in Poland and Central and Eastern European countries. They have been translated into 37 languages and sold over
                    15 million copies worldwide as of December 2019. They have also been adapted into a film (The Hexer), two television series (The Hexer and The Witcher), a video game series,
                    and a series of comic books. The video games have been even more successful, with more than 50 million copies sold as of May 2020.

                    <b>Brave New World</b> is a dystopian novel by English author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic World State,
                    whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology,
                    sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by the story's protagonist.
                  <p></p>
                    Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with his final novel, Island (1962), the utopian counterpart. Brave New World has frequently been banned and challenged since its original publication. It has landed on the American Library Association list of top 100
                    banned and challenged books of the decade since the association began the list in 1990.

                    <b>The Plague</b> is a novel by Albert Camus. Published in 1947, it tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran.
                    The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's
                    distinctive absurdist point of view.
                  <p></p>
                    The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to
                  affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material
                  often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.

                    <b>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</b> is an 1889 novel by American humorist and writer Mark Twain. In the book, a Yankee engineer from Connecticut named Hank Morgan receives a
                    severe blow to the head and is somehow transported in time and space to England during the reign of King Arthur. After some initial confusion and his capture by one of Arthur's
                    knights, Hank realizes that he is actually in the past, and he uses his knowledge to make people believe that he is a powerful magician. He becomes a rival of Merlin, who appears to be
                    little more than a fraud, and gains the trust of King Arthur.
                  <p></p>
                    Hank attempts to modernize the past in order to make people's lives better. Hank is disgusted by how the Barons treat the commoners,
                    and tries to implement democratic reforms, but in the end he is unable to prevent the death of Arthur. Hank declares England a republic, but the Catholic Church, growing fearful of his power,
                    issues an interdict against him.
